# Assumptions

The functionality of the toolkit is based on the following assumptions.  

- The code in the project compiles. 
- Each ViewModel class is in a separate file.
- The name of a file matches the name of the class it contains.
- The namespace of a class corresponds to the project name and folder structure. (There is some flexibility in this.)
- **C#** code always includes opening and closing curly braces and they are on their own lines.

Where code does not meet these expectations the result of using any toolkit functionality cannot be guaranteed.
